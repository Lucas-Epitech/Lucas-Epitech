## About Me

Computer science student with a strong interest in building reliable and efficient software
for real-world applications.

My background in low-level programming (C / C++) has trained me to work with
performance, memory management and code robustness in mind.
I enjoy understanding how systems work internally and tackling complex technical problems.

I regularly work on personal projects to strengthen my skills in:
- software design
- data handling
- system-level programming
